# Flag Guesser

This project is a small Guess Flag/Guess Country game.

You can select between those two modes and also filter out by continents or just go worldwide.

On every round you are offered 4 options, and if yopu pick the right one you advance, otherwise you have to start over.

There is also a best runs page where you can see your best results, and it works with browser local storage, so the results stay after you close the page.

## Code

Project is basically done with React and some bootstrap css.

I did a small python script to format the country codes so its easier to call flags on every step

Have fun!
